# Answers
**A1:**

Pseudo Code is more close to programming language and uses native English Language words or sentences to write parts of code.

**A2:**

Black-box testing checks if the desired outputs are produced when valid input values are given. It does not verify the actual implementation of the program.

**A3:**
Because if your set the initial capacity too high it will makes an iteration over collection requires time proportional to the capacity of the hashmap. 

**A4:**
* Automatic: Invoking of tests as well as checking results for PASS/FAIL should be automatic.
* Repeatable: Test should produce the same results each time and it should not rely on uncontrollable params.
* Independent: Tests should test only one thing at a time. Also, tests should not rely on each other (isolated).

**A5:** 

1. With a less successful project manager, the project can become a series of code sprints. If this happens, the project is likely to come in late and over budget
2. As the initial project doesn’t have a definitive plan, the final product can be grossly different than what was initially intended.
